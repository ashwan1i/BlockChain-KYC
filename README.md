# BlockChain-KYC
KYC-chain eliminates the redundant KYC checks that banks currently perform by maintaining  a common secure database in a block-chain. The nature of a block-chain ensures that  unauthorized changes to the data are automatically invalidated. The proof-of-reputation concept  makes the verification process more robust. Currently we have built this registry over a local test-net that we hosted our personal laptops. So, there are a few limitations regarding scalability such as the maximum number of  banks that can be registered which is currently capped at 10 and so on. Going ahead we  plan to deploy this registry over the Ethereum network to increase its scalability.
